# Hardware Information Gatherner using WMI
Get information about your most common hardware components, like your CPU, GPU, RAM, Disk Drives etc.


### Super useful when in the following case:
#### Your crush just called you saying that her laptop is so slow.
#### Without thinking much, you ask her what is her laptop's CPU, how many gigs of RAM it has and if it has an SSD...
#### There is a weird silence and 10 seconds later she answers you "I had spaghetti for launch! :)"

## RUN_ME.bat
#### Instead of manually activating scripts and then python .py file, just run RUN_ME.bat and it will do the job!
